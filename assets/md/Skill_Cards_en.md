# Skill cards

We have renamed **Command Cards** (white-backed cards) to **Skill Cards** and **Gambit Cards** (black-backed cards) tp **Tactic Cards**. We found that no one remembered the original names, so making it something more flavourful has removed this issue.

Cards with the status of 'playtesting' are still being balanced and tweaked. Feel free to try them out, but they won't be as polished as the other cards.

A status of 'revised' means that the card is mechanically the same to the original, but the wording has been improved.

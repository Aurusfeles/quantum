# Tactic cards

All Tactics now show up twice in the Tactic Deck. The variety of Skills in the original Quantum was a huge selling point for the game, so we tried to design more Tactics to have the same effect. This will also reduce repeats and locked face-up cards for selection.


Cards with the status of 'playtesting' are still being balanced and tweaked. Feel free to try them out, but they won't be as polished as the other cards.

A status of 'revised' means that the card is mechanically the same to the original, but the wording has been improved.
